## Features

- Place orders for available menu items
- Choose payment methods (Cash or Card)

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher (I can't remember what java I used, I think it was 21)

Just Google it, if you don't know how to install Java. Ask ChatGpt for any help.

#### Windows / macOS

1. Download and Install Java from the [official Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. I think, I don't need to tell you what to do next.
3. Install Java via the installer. Just Double-click the downloaded `.exe` or `.dmg` file and follow the instructions to install Java.
4. You can verify the installation by running `java -version` in Command Prompt.
