# Math Collection

There some programs that do something mathematical.

## Features

- **Box**: Calculate the volume and surface area of a box.
- **Triangle**: Calculate the area and perimeter of a triangle.
- **intSolver**: Do something useless with integers.
- **CollatzConjecture**: Calculate the Collatz Conjecture.
- **PascalTriangle**: Print Pascal's Triangle.
- **FibonacciSequence**: Print the Fibonacci sequence.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher (use whatever you want, I don't care)

### Installation

Just Google it, if you don't know how to install Java. Ask ChatGpt for any help.

#### Windows / macOS

1. Download and Install Java from the [official Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. I think, I don't need to tell you what to do next.
3. Install Java via the installer. Just Double-click the downloaded `.exe` or `.dmg` file and follow the instructions to install Java.
4. You can verify the installation by running `java -version` in Command Prompt.

#### Linux

- If you are using a Linux, I think you already know what to do. You don't need my help.

## Usage

### Clone the Repository

#### Using Git

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/DanyilT/Java.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
    - For Windows:
         ```sh
         cd Java\Math\src
         ```
    - For macOS and Linux:
         ```sh
         cd Java/Math/src
         ```

#### Downloading the ZIP File

1. Download the ZIP file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DanyilT/Java.git) and extract it.
2. Navigate to the project folder in the extracted directory (`Java/Math/src`).

### Run the Program

1. Compile the program:
    ```sh
    javac <program>.java
    ```

2. Run the program:
    ```sh
    java <program>
    ```
